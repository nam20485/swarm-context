## Implementation Plan

Each task below must carry **Context** (what exists / where), **Acceptance Criteria** (observable), and **Validation** (the command or check that proves it) — the GH issue hierarchy and every swarm task input are derived from these.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
- [ ] 1.1. Repository and solution bootstrap
- [ ] 1.2. Core dependencies and configuration
- [ ] 1.3. Runtime/Model initialization (if AI)
- [ ] 1.4. Data/Knowledge base foundation (if RAG)
- [ ] 1.5. Basic content processing/indexing (if applicable)

### Phase 2: Core Services / Core Engine

#### Workstream 2.1: Core Module/Service A

- [ ] 2.1. Implement core module/service A
   - [ ] 2.1.1. Sub-task A
   - [ ] 2.1.2. Sub-task B

#### Workstream 2.2: Core Module/Service B

- [ ] 2.2. Implement core module/service B

### Phase 3: UI/UX & Integration

#### Workstream 3.1: UI Foundation

- [ ] 3.1. UI foundation and navigation
- [ ] 3.2. ViewModels/State management
- [ ] 3.3. Primary user flows (chat/task/…)
- [ ] 3.4. Async ops, cancellation, error handling
- [ ] 3.5. Settings/configuration

### Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities & Security

#### Workstream 4.1: Tooling & Agentic Features

- [ ] 4.1. Tooling/Function calling/Agentic features (if applicable)
- [ ] 4.2. Human-in-the-loop approval and auditing
- [ ] 4.3. Performance optimizations and caching
- [ ] 4.4. Observability and dashboards

### Phase 5: Testing, Docs, Packaging & Deployment

#### Workstream 5.1: Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] 5.1. Test suites (unit/integration/e2e/perf)
- [ ] 5.2. API/Developer documentation
- [ ] 5.3. Containerization/installer packaging
- [ ] 5.4. IaC/Environments/CI-CD pipelines
- [ ] 5.5. Final hardening and release checklist
